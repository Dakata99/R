# Reading Data

## Reading from the command line

```scan()``` function will scan the keyboard until an empty line is specified.

If the file that you are going to read is saved in your working directory, you do not need to specify the whole path to the file or you can use file.choose function.

read.table reads a file and creates a data frame from it. By default it doesnâ€™t have a header.

```{r}
#| eval: false
ourData <- read.table("./data.txt", header = TRUE, sep="")
head(ourData)
```
